## Description

EZ Pass WV is a modern web-based application designed to simulate and manage toll transactions for West Virginia’s EZ Pass system. The project focuses on providing a clean, easy-to-use interface where users can track toll expenses, view receipts, and manage transaction history efficiently. Built using React, the application emphasizes performance, modular design, and scalability.

The primary goal of EZ Pass WV is to demonstrate how a toll management dashboard can be implemented using modern front-end technologies. It is suitable for developers learning React, component-based architecture, and basic state management. The application structure is simple yet flexible, allowing future expansion such as user authentication, real-time toll updates, and backend integration.

EZ Pass WV is ideal for educational purposes, demo projects, and portfolio showcases. The codebase follows best practices and is well-organized to make onboarding easy for new contributors. This project also promotes open-source collaboration and encourages developers to contribute enhancements and ideas.
